Title: An RStudio add-in keyboard shortcut to quickly view data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tommy Morrison
Maintainer: Tommy Morrison
Description: 
    Use this keyboard shortcut to view a data.frame or data.table in RStudio's built-in data viewer.
	
	The shortcut wraps all the text on your current line in `View()` and executes it, which will result in RStudio opening a data viewer tab with your data.
	
	The shortcut will work as long as the complete line returns a data.frame/data.table/tibble when executed normally. It will not work if there is a comment at the end of the line, or for piped functions that wrap multiple lines.
	
	To use, you must bind the function to a keyboard shortcut in RStudio by going to `Tools -> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts...` and finding the entry "View data on cursor line". I have bound it to `Ctrl + ,`.
